# CI/CD stack using chainguard

This is a demo for setting up a CI/CD stack and comparing public container images to chainguard images. 

Sets up Jenkins, a small jenkins job which runs some security scanning on the images, prometheus and grafana for some dashboards at some point, and for now just a baked in small nginx app.
